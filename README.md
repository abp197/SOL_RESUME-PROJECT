# SQL Data Analysis Project – Books Store

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills by performing **data analysis and SQL operations** on a Books Store dataset.  
The dataset is provided in **Excel format** and consists of three related tables: **Books, Customers, and Orders**.

All core SQL concepts such as filtering, joins, subqueries, aggregations, and data analysis queries are applied to extract meaningful insights from the data.
